/*What is a Directory?
A directory is a unit in a computerâ€™s file system that helps store and organize files. Directories are arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, where they follow a parent-child relationship. Directories are also called folders.
A directory is just a folder in Windows where we store our files. We can create, delete, and rename them as needed.

 Creating a Directory
 In Go, we use os.Mkdir to create a new directory with a specified name and permissions. */
